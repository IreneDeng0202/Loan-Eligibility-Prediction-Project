# 1. Project Overview
This project develops and evaluates machine learning models to predict loan eligibility for applicants based on demographic and financial features. The goal is to help financial institutions make data-driven decisions in loan approvals, balancing risk control and customer acquisition.

# 4.Conclusion
The Random Forest model achieved the best balance between accuracy (approximately 80%) and interpretability.
The most influential features in predicting loan approval were Credit_History and LoanAmount, indicating that applicants with positive credit history and manageable loan amounts were more likely to receive approval.
